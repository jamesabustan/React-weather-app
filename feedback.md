Really slick UX! Well done! Only down side is that you deviated from the brief given, although you did comment on it in your README. A really nice app otherwise - Great job! 

* test should be phrased as statements rather than questions.
* Well done for getting 4 tests working 
* a couple of deviations from the brief - 5 tests requested and two routes - acknowledged in the awesome documentation!
