# React-Weather-App
#### James Abustan

### Project Brief
* Application is to have a homepage with a placeholder image on one side of the screen, on the other there is a text input with a button. 
* User will be able to enter the name of a location such as a City and/or Country.
* On submission a request will be submitted to an endpoint. 
* Must be able to call two API's - one for the weather, the second for an image which will be presented. 
* Have a homepage link so the user can go back to the homepage and search for a new city.Â 

### What challenges I overcame
* Running tests
* Importing external css modules to each components

### What I have learned
* Introduce simple animations via css with Unsplash API
* Passing state functions to components

### What challenges I overcame
* wrote some tests to check components rendering
* Pass through data and fetching API

### What I struggled with
* Issue with running the NPM Test - sorted by watchman

### What I would do differently next time 
* Implement Routing although not implemented in the project due to overlooking of project brief
* Learn and write more meaningful tests - Test as I go along
* Refactor code where appropriate
